WHEN I MUST USE INSTANCE METHOD RATHER THAN STATIC ?
when you need to access or modify
the object's attribute (instance field)
Inheritance
IS-A Relationship :
public class Car{ }
public class ElectricCar extends Car{
}
-- THIS IS A VALID STATEMENT
ElectricCar is a Car
Dog is a Animal
Employee is a Person
SalariedEmployee is a Employee
--- THIS IS NOT VALID !!!
Car is a ElectricCar
Person is a Teacher
----  WE CAN INHERITE --
as long its visible|accessible
fields ( instance and static )
methods ( instance and static )
constructor is not inherited !!!!
how can we reuse the logic defined in super class constructor
we can call using super(arguments..)
method overriding :
sub class can override the content of
inherited super class instance method
to provide its own implementation
@Override is called annotation
it will ensure the method is correctly overrien once being used
and its optional to use
but highly recommended
// super class method
 private void doSomething(){
 	// doing bunch of stuff
 }
 // sub class method
 private void doSomething(){
 	// doing bunch of stuff
 }
ABOVE IS NOT OVERRIDING BECAUSE THEY DONT SEE EACH OTHER AT ALL
IT WILL COMPILE
// super class method
 void doSomething(){
 	// doing bunch of stuff
 }
 // sub class method
 private void doSomething(){
 	// doing bunch of stuff
 }
ABOVE IS NOT A VALID OVERRIDING BECAUSE ACCESS MODIFER
IN SUB CLASS SHOULD BE SAME OR MORE VISIBLE
default --->> default, protected , public
// super class method
 public void doSomething(){
 	// doing bunch of stuff
 }
 // sub class method
 public void doSomething(){
 	// doing bunch of stuff
 }
ABOVE IS VALID OVERRIDING
// super class method
 private void doSomething(){
 	// doing bunch of stuff
 }
 // sub class method
 //@Override /-->> error!!!!!!!
 public void doSomething(){
 	// doing bunch of stuff
 }
IS IT A OVERRIDING???  NO@@!!!!!!!
DOES IT COMPILE ???
