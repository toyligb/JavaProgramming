Practice Topics: 1. final keyword
				 2. this & super keywords
final keyword: constant,  immutable
		only applicable:
			1. variables: cannot be changed (re-assigned)
						instance & static variables need to be initialized immedietly
						if the instance variables is private & final, we can only generate getter
			2. methods: the implementation/functionality can not changed. (cannot be overriden)
			3. class (none abstract): immutable class
					cannot be super class ( cannot be inherited)
					but can be sub class
object instances: contsructor, instance variables, instance methods
this: refers to the objects instances ( from current class)
	this. : calls the instance variables and instance methods
	this(): calls the constructor
	cannot be used in static methods and static blocks
super: refers to the object instances ( from super class)
		there must an inheritance relationship
	super. : calls the instance variables and instance methods ( from super class)
	super(): calls the constructor ( from super class)
	cannot be used in static methods and static blocks
this() & super() rules:
				1. only a constructor can call another constructor
				2. constructor cannot be called by thier names
						we need to use this() or super() to call
				3. constructor call MUST be at the first step in constructor's body
				4. A constructor cannot call more than one constructor
				5. Constructor cannot call or contain itself
				6. super class' constructor Must be called in sub class
				7. super class' default constructor is called by default in sub class
constructor rules:
		1. constructor cannot be overriden, but can be overloaded
		2. Constructor' execution ALWAYS depends on the object
		3. Every class must have constructor
		4. Constructor name MUST be same with class Name
		5. constructor does not have return type or specifiers
		6. class object MUST be created with existing constructor
