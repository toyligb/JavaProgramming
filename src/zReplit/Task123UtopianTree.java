 * The Utopian Tree grows exactly 1 cm for the first three years,
 * and after that it grows by 2 cm every year,
 * this is a simple implementation of the algorithm.
 * You will need to use loops to create it.
 * Show 10 years of growth of the Utopian Tree.

Output:
year 1 - growth 1 cm
tree size: 1cm
year 2 - growth 1 cm
tree size: 2cm
year 3  - growth 1 cm
tree size:3cm
year 4 - growth 2 cm
tree size: 5cm
year 5 - growth 2 cm
tree size: 7cm
year 6 - growth 2 cm
tree size: 9cm
... until you reach year 10
